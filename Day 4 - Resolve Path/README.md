### Problem 4: Resolve Path

**Problem Statement:**
Create a function `resolvePath(relativePath)` that takes a relative path as input and resolves it to an absolute path using the `path` module. The function should print the resolved path to the console.

**Function Signature:**
```javascript
function resolvePath(relativePath) {
    // Implementation
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Resolved Path: /Users/username/project/folder/file.txt
```

**Test Cases:**
```javascript
resolvePath('../project/folder/file.txt');
// Expected Output: Resolved Path: /Users/username/project/folder/file.txt

resolvePath('nonexistent-folder/file.txt');
// Expected Output: Resolved Path: /Users/username/nonexistent-folder/file.txt
```
